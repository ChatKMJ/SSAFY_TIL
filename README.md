# Repository Introduction

> #### This repository serves as a space to record my learnings during the SSAFY training and share the projects I've worked on. I mainly use it to document my TIL (Today I Learned) entries, where I organize the topics I've studied. Additionally, I share the code and results of various hands-on projects.
